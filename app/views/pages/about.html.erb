    <h1>The ZokuVault Story</h1>
    <p>
      ZokuVault was founded to provide individuals and families with a safe, secure and organized alternative to current estate planning, family organization and risk management solutions.
      <br><br>
      There are too many stories of friends and family dealing with personal loss or tragedy, where on top of the bad circumstances, they found themselves unprepared and disorganized, struggling to manage the situation and spinning in circles.
      <br><br>
      We created ZokuVault because we are just like you, in need of a better solution to organize and share the most important information in our lives. Our founding team brings both their work experiences in the realm of family risk management and their need as parents and adult children in their own growing families to ZokuVault every day.

    <h1>Our Advice</h1>
    <p>Break the inertia! So many people do not begin their estate plan or documentation process out of a feeling of
overwhelming inertia. There is a fear of needing to complete everything at once. The solution is to start small. Just identifying the top 4 or 5 key contacts is 50% of the battle to most families. Get them into ZokuVault now and chip away over time. Before you know it, you will have an estate plan to be proud of.</p>
