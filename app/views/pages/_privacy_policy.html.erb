<p>Your Account Content</p>
<p>Your Account content (“Account Content” or “Content”) includes the electronic files and information you upload and input into your Account. You and the Users you designate as Contacts control the access and use of your Content. We contract with third-party service providers to furnish and support the Services including the storage of your encrypted Account Content. Your Account Content remains encrypted and neither we nor our third-party service providers access, use or share your Account Content for any purpose, except at your direction or as required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>We retain your personal information and your Account Content for as long as your Account is active, or as needed to provide you services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>Information Sharing</p>
<p>We access, use and share your personal information, Account Content and technical and navigational data only as described in this Privacy Policy. In our sole discretion, we may also access and disclose your personal information, Account Content and technical and navigational data as required or permitted by law or legal process. Examples of “legal process” include but are not limited to subpoenas, warrants, injunctions, restraining orders, forfeitures or government requests for information.</p>
<p>Protection of your Information</p>
<p>We consider all or your Account Content highly sensitive information and we protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of your Account Content by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural controls. We protect your personal information and the files stored in our system with strong encryption. As advances in technology occur and requirements change, we will adapt our controls to meet evolving demands. When you upload a file to the Site, we scan it for viruses and other malware. When we use email to communicate with you, we use a technology that enables us to digitally sign our messages so that our Users can verify that the messages have not been forged or altered. The Site will automatically log you off after an extended period of inactivity which reduces the risk that others could access your information from your unattended Account. We use security systems to monitor the Site around the clock to provide you with timely and secure access to your Account. We restrict physical access to work areas and limit access to and closely monitor systems containing User electronic files. We are trained in security practices and emerging risks such as identity theft. While we use encryption, firewall barriers, authentication procedures, audit logs and other protections to maintain the security of your Content and prevent unauthorized access, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p>When you register for an Account on the Site, you must provide an email address and verify that email address. You must also create a secure secret password, which will allow you safe and secure access to your files. We have protective procedures to assist in your secure login and we verify your identity before granting you access to your Account. When you log in from a computer we do not recognize, we may ask you to provide a one-time security PIN that we send to your previously registered device which helps us ensure that it is really you accessing your account.</p>
