    <h1>The ZokuVault Story</h1>
    <p>
      ZokuVault was founded to provide individuals and families with a safe, secure and organized alternative to current estate planning, family organization and risk management solutions.
      <br><br>
      Too often we hear stories of friends and family finding themselves unprepared, spinning in circles and struggling to find what they need at a time of personal loss or tragedy.
      <br><br>
      We created ZokuVault because we are just like you: In need of a better solution to organize and share the most important information in our lives. Our founding team brings together work experiences in the realms of family risk management and technology as well as their own personal experiences as parents and adult-aged children.

    </div>
    <p>
      Break the inertia!
      <br><br>
      It is difficult to begin any project when it seems so daunting. This perception grows with every day of inaction and is compounded by fear that you must solve your estate planning and risk management solution needs all at once.
      <br><br>
      The key is to just start and start small.  Simply storing a handful of documents and identifying the most important people to contact is 50% of the battle for most families.
      <br><br>
      Get the easy information into ZokuVault now, and chip away at the rest of it over time. Before you know it, you will have the easily executable estate plan that you hoped for and can sleep better at night.
